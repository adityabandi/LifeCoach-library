          <h2>Conclusion</h2>
          <p>
            Effective offboarding transforms the end of a coaching relationship into the beginning of a long-term professional connection. By celebrating achievements, maintaining relationships, and creating systems for reactivation, you build a network of advocates who fuel your practice's growth.
          </p>

          <p>
            Remember: every client who graduates successfully becomes a potential referral source, testimonial provider, and future client. Invest in ending well, and those relationships will continue to serve both you and them for years to come.
          </p>

          <p>
            The goal isn't to end coaching relationships—it's to evolve them into lasting connections that support continued growth for everyone involved.
